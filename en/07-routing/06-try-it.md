# Try it

Let's try what we have so far. Run the application by doing:

```
npm run dev
```

in one terminal, and:

```
npm run api
```

in another terminal.

Then go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You should see the list of users.

If you go to `http://localhost:3000/#/players/2` then you should see one user.

Next we will add some navigation.
