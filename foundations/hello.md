# Hello

Let's write our first Elm application, create a folder for your application and add a `hello.elm` file. In this file write:

```elm
import Html

main =
  Html.text "Hello"
```

Go to this folder on the terminal and type:

```
elm reactor
```

This should show you:

```
elm reactor 0.16.0
Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8000/
```
