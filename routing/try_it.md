# Try it

We have added the necessary wiring to have a working router.

Try it:

- Going to `http://localhost:3000/#/players` should show you a list of player
- Going to `http://localhost:3000/#/players/1/edit` should show you the player edit view
- Going to `http://localhost:3000/#/xyz` should show you "Not found"

At this point your application code should look like <https://github.com/sporto/elm-tutorial-app/tree/150-routing>


Next step is to add some navigation
