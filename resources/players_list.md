This view shows a list of users. 

#### ViewModel

This view expects a `ViewModel` as model. Why not just pass a list of users? That would be fine for many cases, but often in your views you might need additional data. By creating a view model we allow space to evolve without having to refactor too much later.

Also note:

- `bonuses` is hardcoded to `999` for now, we will need to get this from other models.
