# Backend

We will need a backend for our application, we can use __json-server__ for this.

Start a new node project:

```
npm init
```

Accept all the defaults.

Install __json-server__:

```
npm i json-server -S
```

Make `index.js` in the root of the project:

```js
ss
```

Add `db.json` at the root:

```
d
```

Start the server by doing:

```bash
node index.js
```
