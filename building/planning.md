# Planning

We will build an application that tracks an imaginary roll playing game, this game will have __playes__ and __perks__ that can be associated with each player. 

This application will demonstrate:

- Multiple views
- Nested components
- Breaking the application into resources
- Routing
- Shared state accross the application
- State specific to a component
- Editing
- Validations
- Ajax requests

## Wireframes:

The application will have three views:
