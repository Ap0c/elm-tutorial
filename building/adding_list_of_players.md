# Adding a list of players

Let's create some content for our application.

## Players Model

Create __src/Players/Models.elm__.

```elm
module Players.Models (..) where


type alias PlayerId =
  Int


type alias Player =
  { id : PlayerId
  , name : String
  , level : Int
  }


new : Player
new =
  { id = 0
  , name = ""
  , level = 1
  }
```

## Players actions

Create a file __src/Players/Actions.elm__

```elm
module Players.Actions (..) where

import Http
import Players.Models exposing (PlayerId, Player)


type Action
  = NoOp
```

Here we will put all the actions related to players.
